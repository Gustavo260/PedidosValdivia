        	Shining Force II gameplay is a tactical role-playing game. There are two forms of gameplay: exploration and battles. When exploring, the player assumes the role of the Shining Force leader. The player can walk around, interact with people, and set the members and equipment of the army. It is also possible to find a headquarters in some towns where the player can inspect and talk with allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.

Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are also hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the allies. Not all the characters can be used during a single battle so the player must mix and match their forward team. The main character, Bowie, must be in every battle.
